  <h1> Our Mission Statement </h1>
  <p> We hope to provide and connect black patients to medical professionals and resources to ensure they receive the most comfortable health care. </p>

</section>


 <section class="pillars">
     <div class="grid-item">Equity</div>
       <p>Equity in healthcare means giving people what they need to reach their best health, and the Health-e Team truly believes that healthcare is a human right. We want to enable our audience to find the best and most equitable care to suit their everyday healthcare needs. We believe that ensuring equity in access to healthcare resources will encourage overall growth in the black community. </p>
     <div class="grid-item">Honesty</div>
     <p>"Honesty is the best policy. If I lose mine honor, I lose myself." - William Shakespear couldn’t have said it better. Here at Health-e-Melanin we believe in providing the most open and honest environment we can offer, from our resources to our physicians. We believe honesty build trust, and trust builds family.  </p>
     <div class="grid-item">Respect</div>
      <p>Respect is an essential component of any high-performance organization and is especially important to Health-e-Melanin. It helps to create a healthy environment in which patients feel cared for as individuals, and health care providers are engaged, collaborative, and committed to service. We want to make sure that the needs of the audience are respected and prioritized to ensure that they get the best care.</p>

                 <p> I am a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in civil engineering at the University of Cincinnati. Through my collegiate experience, I have come to realize that I want to be an engineer because I want my work to serve my community in an effective way and help solve problems that are important to society. I am passionate about developing solutions to address the racial disparities in healthcare access and resources. </p>

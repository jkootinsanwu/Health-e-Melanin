                There are many things you can do to protect your children. One of the main techniques for protecting children would be vaccination.
                Vaccines are recommended throughout your child’s life to protect against serious, sometimes deadly diseases.
                Find out which vaccines are recommended for your child based on their age <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/by-age/index.html">here</a> at the CDC website.
                Along with the recommendation, some states require certain vaccinations. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/awardee-imz-websites.html">This link</a> goes to the list of those requirements by state.

                Along with vaccinations, Childhood nutrition is also a very important factor. Nearly 1 in 3 children in America is overweight or obese. 
                Despite all the focus on kids being overweight and obese, many parents are still confused, especially when it comes to what kids eat. 
                How much does your child need? Is he getting enough calcium? Enough iron? Too much fat? Whether you have a toddler or a teen, nutrition is important to his or her physical and mental development. 
                HealthyChildren.org has laid out exactly what children need — no matter what the age - <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Childhood-Nutrition.aspx">here</a>.

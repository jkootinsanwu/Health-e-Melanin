            <h2>Mental Health
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important and yet overlooked aspects of our overall health is not physical, but mental.

                The current stigma revolving mental health is FINALLY being broken down, but sometimes it's hard to connect with professionals who don't share the same identity as you.
                <br />
                <br />
                While the overall mental health conditions occur in Black and African American people in the US at about the same frequency as White Americans, the historical experience in the US has and still is characterized by trauma and violence more than White counterparts and impacts the emotional and mental health for both youth and adults.

                We can indeed connect you to Black professionals in the mental health field, but please also look into the following Mental Health resources for Black and African American communities.

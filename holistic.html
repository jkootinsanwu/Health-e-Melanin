    <h1>Holistic Health</h1>
    <p>Not a fan of Western Medicine? Don't worry, you're not alone!</p>
    <p>
        For those who don't know, Holistic Health is actually an approach to life. Rather than focusing on illness or specific parts of the body, 
        this ancient approach to health considers the whole person and how he or she interacts with his or her environment. It emphasizes the connection of mind, body, and spirit. 
        The goal is to achieve maximum well-being, where everything is functioning the very best that is possible. 
        With Holistic Health people accept responsibility for their own level of well-being, and everyday choices are used to take charge of one’s own health.

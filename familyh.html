            <p>
                A study out of the University of Michigan shows that when physicians and patients share the same race or ethnicity, 
                this improves time spent together, medication adherence, shared decision-making, wait times for treatment, cholesterol screening, patient understanding of cancer risk, 
                and patient perceptions of treatment decisions <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27325865">(1)</a>. 
                This means that patients trust their doctors more, and are more likely to listen to advice, including preventative care that generally improves the lifespan of patients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Living longer means having the opportunity to make more lasting memories with loved ones - 
                something we're sure that most people desire. Giving this opportunity to all people, regardless of skin color, would greatly improve the quality of life for many.

            <h2>Covid-19 Testing</h2>
            <h3>Before getting tested for COVID-19, consider these criteria: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you have symptoms of COVID-19?</li>
                    <li>Have you  had close contact (within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes) with someone with confirmed COVID-19? </li>
                    <li>Have you been asked or referred to get testing by a healthcare provider or health department? </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Everyone does not NEED to be tested. If you do get tested, you should self-quarantine/isolate at home pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional.  </p>
                <h3>Here are some more resources regarding testing: </h3>

            <h2>At Home Mask Creation</h2>
            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people "wear masks in public settings when around people who don’t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”  </p>
            <p> Masks with at least 2 layers of fabric are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings. Simple masks can be made at home using washable, breathable fabric and may help prevent the spread of COVID-19.  </p>
            <p> Some tutorials and resources regarding such can be seen below. </p>
